To remove your companion just- uhm I forgot...
You'll figure it out!

## System Requirements
- A Mac (because geese don't like windows, obviously).

- Wifi i guess

### Windows!
If you **reaaaaaally** want a windows version than go sift through the BadUSB files and you'll be able to get it.
(The BadUSB thingy is really cool though.)
